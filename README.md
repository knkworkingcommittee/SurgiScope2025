**SurgiScope2025** is an innovative e-booklet initiative by the **DFC Working Committee, Kankavli**, dedicated to exploring the evolving relationship between diagnostic technology and surgical intervention. As medical science continues to make leaps in precision diagnostics and minimally invasive procedures, this booklet captures the essence of these advancements and their impact on modern surgical practice. It serves as a platform to highlight the latest tools, case studies, and integrated approaches that are shaping the future of patient care.

This digital compendium is the result of collaborative efforts from clinicians, diagnosticians, and healthcare innovators, aiming to bridge the gap between investigation and intervention. Through *SurgiScope2025*, we hope to spark insightful discussions, promote knowledge-sharing, and encourage a more cohesive approach to diagnostics-led surgery — ultimately improving outcomes and enhancing the patient journey.
